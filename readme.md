# Mines

This is a mines swipper game written in Turbo 
Pascal 7. 

If you plan in fixing the code - just cosmetic pull requests. I will not maintian this game besides the historical value. 

You will need TP7 (or compatible compiler for DOS) in order to compile it.

Home page contains also a zip with the EXEs

Game is MCGA, uses mouse it quite trivial code.

The images were edited using a picture editor, 
which is not currently available online. The 
file format is just a raw dump of memory for 
the images.
